##Scenario
Build a "Next 5" Web app that consumes an API.
##Overview

To make it easy for our customers to place bets on upcoming races that are close to starting, we display a module that lists the Next 5 upcoming races, sorted by time.

Please create, in a public repository, a functional website that loads a list of Next 5 races.

You are free to use any frameworks (or none) you wish to complete this task.

##UI Requirements
    1. The index page will always contain a list of the next 5 races that are open for betting
    2. The races will be sorted by their closing time, ascendingly
    3. The races will be a mix of the 3 types
        a. Thoroughbred
        b. Greyhounds
        c. Harness
    4. Each race will countdown to when betting is suspended
    5. When betting is suspended on a race, it will disappear from the list.
    6. Clicking on a race will take you to the race page.
    7. The race page will contain a list of all the competitors in the race, as well as their position.
